# Welcome to My Repository!  

This repository showcases my skills and progress in solving problems on Leetcode.  

## About Me  

I’m a beginner in the IT field, currently studying Data Science and Machine Learning. As part of my learning process, I’ve decided to focus on solving problems, particularly from the **Pandas** and **SQL** section. 

## Important Notes
